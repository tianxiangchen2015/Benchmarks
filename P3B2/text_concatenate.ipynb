slightly more than 50 although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21 s7681 lack of responsiveness to tki mutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of nsclc to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy l861q increased responsiveness to tkis the missense mutation l861q confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding this mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild type receptor to

existing t790m resistance clone exon 20 insertion lack of responsiveness to tkis insertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of nsclc to gefitinib or erlontinib

areas of interest were identified and selectively microdissected from the paraffin embedded tissue section the collected cells were lysed and the genomic dna was purified from the sample the dna yield was determined and the samples were brought to an optimal concentration real time pcr was used to evaluate specific mutations deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr gene eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18 21 as well as the wild type sequence intended use the egfr mutation analysis by real time pcr is able to detect the wild type sequence and 29 known mutations deletions and insertions found in exons 18 21 of the egfr tyrosine kinase domain the results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management the intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient there is a significant association between egfr mutation especially exon 19 deletion and response to tki s this assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1 5 in a background of wild type alleles these mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to egfr inhibitors such as gefitinib iressa and erlotinib tarceva an alteration not detected result does not preclude the

her2 test is defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells 2 the correlation between her2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry and her2 neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is not 100 rare cases interpreted as negative 0 and 1 for her2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low level her2 neu gene amplification by fish approximately 10 20 of cases interpreted as 2 may show gene amplification by fish while the vast majority

score of 3 positive her2 test is defined by uniform intense membrane staining in 30 of tumor cells a score of 2 equivocal her2 test is defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells 2 the correlation between her2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry and her2 neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is not 100 rare cases interpreted as negative 0 and 1 for her2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low level her2 neu gene amplification by fish approximately 10 20 of cases interpreted as 2 may show gene amplification by fish while the vast majority of cases if not all interpreted as 3 show gene amplification by fish

appropriate reactivity determination of er pr reactivity is based on manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells and interpretation of herceptest for her2 neu is by following

dr name comment some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1 positive tumor cells for er pr may correlate with a significantly improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant hormonal therapy based on this information tumors showing greater than 1 of tumor cell nuclear staining for er pr may be considered positive the guideline recommendations by asco cap in 2007 is as follows a score of 3 positive her2 test is defined by uniform intense membrane staining in 30 of tumor cells a score of 2 equivocal her2 test is defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells the correlation of her2 neu protein overexpression by the dako herceptest and her2 neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is not 100 rare cases interpreted as negative 0 and 1 for her2 neu protein over expression may

formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue sections a1 routine histologic examination of the right breast demonstrates invasive carcinoma positive and negative controls show appropriate reactivity determination of er pr reactivity is based on manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells and interpretation of herceptest for her2 neu is by following guidelines recommended

an addendum report study requested by dr name m comment some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1 positive tumor cells for er pr may correlate with a significantly improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant hormonal therapy based on this information tumors showing greater than 1 of tumor cell nuclear staining for er pr may be considered positive the guideline recommendations by asco cap in 2007 is as follows a score of 3 positive her2 test is defined by uniform intense membrane staining in 30 of tumor cells a score of 2 equivocal her2 test is defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells the correlation of her2 neu protein overexpression by the dako herceptest and her2 neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is not 100 rare cases interpreted as negative 0 and 1 for her2 neu protein over expression may demonstrate her2 neu gene amplification by fish approximately 10 of cases interpreted as 2 show gene amplification by fish and the vast majority but not all cases interpreted as 3 show gene amplification by fish therefore testing for c erb b 2 her2 neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish may be considered if clinically warranted

staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells 2 the correlation between her2 protein

may demonstrate low level her2 neu gene amplification by fish approximately 10 20 of cases interpreted as 2 may show gene amplification by fish while the vast majority of cases if not all interpreted

at least 10 of tumor cells or less commonly intense complete membrane staining but in only 30 or fewer tumor cells a score of 0 or 1 negative her2 test is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane

by pathologists at ucsf see path number 1 the following paragraphs are taken from the comments in the consultation report based on the gross description and the microscopic sections the right lumpectomy shows two apparent masses that are juxtaposed to each other with abrupt transition in morphologic features best demonstrated on slide 11 the larger mass is composed of proliferation of highly cellular spindle cells growing in interweaving fascicles with no obvious epithelial differentiation rare elongated benign tubules are noted within the periphery of the spindle cell mass the spindle cells have pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders the nuclei show a vesicular chromatin pattern with inconspicuous nucleoli mitotic activity varies regionally but overall is moderate to high and measures up to 11 mitotic figures 10hpfs no necrosis is identified no heterologous elements such as lipogenic or chondroid differentiation are identified in the slides available for review although the mass has an overall well circumscribed contour irregular large tongues of growth and microscopic infiltration into adjacent fat are noted and a small satellite nodule is seen on slide 26 the smaller nodule shows a fibroepithelial lesion that in some areas with paucicellular stroma is reminiscent of a fibroadenoma but in other areas displaying increased stromal cellularity and mitotic activity i found 2 mitotic figures in one high power field on slide 8 beyond what would be seen in fibroadenomas and would place this nodule into the category of phyllodes tumor based on the presence of a phyllodes tumor in the smaller nodule and the juxtaposition of the two nodules the differential diagnosis for the larger mass with cellular spindle cells would most likely be part of the phyllodes tumor as the result of stromal overgrowth other consideration includes metaplastic carcinoma or less likely other mesenchymal tumors the following stains were performed and interpreted at hmc cd34 patchy positivity sma positive s 100 negative desmin negative lca negative oscar keratin negative the following stains were performed at ucsf keratin mnf1 negative p63 negative negative staining for epithelial markers and p63 helps exclude the possibility of a metaplastic breast carcinoma negative s100 and desmin argues against melanoma and leiomyosarcoma respectively the histologic features are not those of an angiosarcoma patchy positivity for cd34 can be seen in the stromal component of phyllodes tumors furthermore the presence of rare elongated benign tubules within the large mass also supports this as phyllodes tumor this phyllodes tumor is further categorized as malignant based on stromal overgrowth with highly cellular stroma high mitotic activity and irregular infiltrative border based on slides available for review margins are negative but close 1mm to yellow inked inferior margin and at least one satellite nodule is noted ideally treatment for malignant phyllodes tumors should include widely clear margins 1 cm if possible therefore close follow up is recommended for recurrence and re excision may merit consideration preliminary findings called to the

present after treatment inflammatory carcinoma is a clinical pathologic entity characterized by diffuse erythema and edema peau d orange involving one third or more of the skin of the breast the skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by tumor emboli within dermal lymphatics which may or may not be obvious in a small skin biopsy however a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an invasive carcinoma in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal lymphatics as well as to determine biological markers such as er pr and her2 status tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes described above do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma locally advanced breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma thus the term inflammatory carcinoma should not be applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course of a patient s disease the rare case that exhibits all the features of inflammatory carcinoma but in which skin changes involve less than one third of the skin should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying carcinoma regional lymph nodes pn choose a category based on lymph nodes received with the specimen immunohistochemistry and or molecular

lymph nodes at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2 0 mm approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3 dimensional 0 2 mm cluster thus if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single histologic section of a lymph node there is a high probability that more than 1000 cells are present in the node in these situations the node should be classified as containing a micrometastasis pn1mi cells in different lymph node cross sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not added together the 200 cells must be in a single node profile even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices it is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the itc and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories because of inherent limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden in lymph nodes thus the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories the pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of isolated tumor cells distant metastasis m x not applicable cm0 i no clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastasis but

lymph nodes at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2 0 mm approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3 dimensional 0 2 mm cluster thus if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single histologic section of a lymph node there is a high probability that more than 1000 cells are present in the node in these situations the node should be classified as containing a micrometastasis pn1mi cells in different lymph node cross sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not added together the 200 cells must be in a single node profile even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices it is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the itc and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories because of inherent limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden in lymph nodes thus the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories the pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of isolated tumor cells distant metastasis m x not applicable cm0 i no clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastasis but

invasive lobular carcinoma is noted focally and measures 7 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm the in situ component comprises approximately 90 of the neoplasm present and its size is difficult to estimate because of its presence in multiple tissue blocks and is estimated at between 15mm x 5mm x 5 mm there are extensive calcifications within the breast and these appear to be associated predominantly with two small tubular adenomatous proliferation one of which measures approximately 5mm x 5mm x 5 mm sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within the breast tissue sections of the breast skin and nipple show no definite pagetoid intraepithelial spread and no involvement of the dermal lymphatics sections of the right sentinel lymph node which has been bisected shows mild sinus histiocytosis there is no tumor
